[privilege_escalation]
# (boolean) Display an agnostic become prompt instead of displaying a prompt containing the command line supplied become method.
;agnostic_become_prompt=True

# (boolean) When ``False``(default), Ansible will skip using become if the remote user is the same as the become user, as this is normally a redundant operation. In other words root sudo to root.
# If ``True``, this forces Ansible to use the become plugin anyways as there are cases in which this is needed.

# (boolean) Toggle to prompt for privilege escalation password.

# (boolean) This is a global option, each connection plugin can override either by having more specific options or not supporting pipelining at all.
# Pipelining, if supported by the connection plugin, reduces the number of network operations required to execute a module on the remote server, by executing many Ansible modules without actual file transfer.
# It can result in a very significant performance improvement when enabled.
# However this conflicts with privilege escalation (become). For example, when using 'sudo:' operations you must first disable 'requiretty' in /etc/sudoers on all managed hosts, which is why it is disabled by default.
