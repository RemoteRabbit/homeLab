## Watchgaurd Project

Was able to pickup a Watchgaurd XTM Series 505 for about $30 and have started the process to install pfSense on it and try it out in place of the "larger" server that I am currently using. The main reasons being the Watchgaurd box will consume a little less power and generate less heat while also being substantially quieter at idle and load.
